"""Lesson 9 - the inference engine: load once, generate many times.

    prompt -> tokenizer.encode -> token IDs
          -> model forward (looped)  -> logits for the last position
          -> sampling               -> next token ID
          -> append, repeat until max_tokens or <eos>
          -> tokenizer.decode -> text

The one rule that matters most for latency: the model and tokenizer are
loaded ONCE, in __init__, not per request. Loading a 10M-parameter model from
disk takes real time (hundreds of ms); doing that on every API call would
dominate the actual generation cost.

No KV cache here, on purpose - every new token re-runs the FULL sequence
through the model instead of reusing previous keys/values, which is
quadratic-ish waste for anything beyond a short prompt. For a model this
small, on a CPU-only free host, the difference isn't the bottleneck yet, but
it's worth being able to say precisely why a bigger model would need one.
